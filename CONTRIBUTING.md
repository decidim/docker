# Feature Request

After reading carefully our Code of Conduct, you can propose a new feature on [Meta Decidim](https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap). To have a PR merged, you need first to go through the validation of the feature in Meta Decidim.

# Pull Request

Pull requests are always welcome!
We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We're trying very hard to keep the project lean and focused. We don't want it to do everything for everybody. This means that [@product](https://meta.decidim.org/profiles/product/members) might decide against incorporating a new feature.
